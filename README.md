# gif-overflow

#### *DBC Phase 2 project*

A Stackoverflow clone where users can sign up, log in, and request gifs. Other users can then respond with gifs and/or comment on questions/answers. We're about making the Internet more a giffier place.

### User Stories:

* Logged in users can make comments on GIF requests and GIF responses
* Logged out users can view GIF requests, GIF responses and comments
* All users can view another user's profile and all the GIF requests they have made
* Logged in users can upvote and downvote GIF requests, GIF responses and comments
* Logged in users who present a GIF request can choose the best GIF
